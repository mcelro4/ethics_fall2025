In this podcast we cover the hallucinations of AI with different LLMs like Deepseak and ChatGPT 4.0 asking the question, what ethical concerns coexist with hallucinations. You will listen to us discuss about prompting AI and the difficulties that come with it. As well as the responses that different LLMs output, coming to a conclusion to which LLM is the most effective or trustworthy. Sit back and enjoy our talk! "
