For this activity I will have you take a look at a couple of videos taken on my phone. What you will have are live odds of sports games. Odds change based on the way the game is flowing. For example: Sports like basketball, tennis, etc. are fast paced so the odds change faster. This is on purpose as it draws betters in and once a spread, moneyline, or total score changes to something appealing to the sports gambler they tend to place their bets.

Key terms to know:

Spread: The amount of points a team or player will win by. -2.5 spread in basketball means that the team you bet that spread on will win the game by more than 2.5 points. It varies based on the sport. +2.5 means that the team or player you bet on won't lose by more than 2.5 points or they will outright win the game.

MoneyLine: This just means a gambler picks who they think will win. If a gambler picks Vikings moneyline then they think the Vikings will win the game.

Over/Under: This is a prediction based on the total score of the game between two teams but in single player sports this could be different. An over/under could be games played in a sport like tennis or ping pong.

Below is a video of different live online betting lines. Take a look!
