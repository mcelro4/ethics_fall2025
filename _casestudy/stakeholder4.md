**Betting Companies**

Betting companies almost have the same role as regulators. Betting companies have the responsibility to promote ethical standards and safeguard their users as well. Implementing notifications that communicate time spent on apps, money deposited, providing information on responsible gambling, and implementing measures to detect gambling harm are responsibilities that betting companies have. Betting companies also have to make sure their users are being paid if wins happen and "collaborate with sports organizations to ensure that their actions don't compromise the integrity of the sport."
