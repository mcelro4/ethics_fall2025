    **Learning Objective:**

-   Grasp the concept of algorithmic persuasion in Live sports betting 
-   Evaluate the role of data driven systems in shaping user decision making and leading to compulsive or high risk betting.
-   Analyze how interface design and behavioral techniques are used to encourage continued betting engagement during live sporting events.
-   Assess the ethical implications of algorithmic persuasion in online gambling.
-   Propose strategies for improving transparency, accountability, and ethical design in algorithmic sports betting systems. 

    **Introduction**

    Sports have been around forever, dating back to ancient times, hunting and wrestling were the trailblazers of the sports world that we see now. Sports weren’t documented until around 776 BCE where the first Olympic games took place in Greece. Throughout history, sports have evolved into something that globally, people enjoy watching, participating and gambling. In 1992, the  PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) , effectively banned sports betting in most states. Nevada, being one of the states that it was legal in. By 2010, the state of Nevada was the first state to launch an online sports betting platform called STN sports. By 2018 the Supreme Court overturned PASPA, legalizing online sports betting in multiple states. Since 2025, 38 states, including The District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have legalized sports betting in some form or fashion and 30 states allow online sports betting. However, rules and regulations differ from state to state based on licensing, tax rates, and eligible sports. 

    Since the 2020 COVID pandemic, online sports betting has grown tremendously. Algorithmic Persuasion in live sports betting has grasped the sports community in ways that are impacting entertainment forever. Behind the scenes of live sports betting beholds invisible AI enabled personalization on gaming sites that can affect users experience. There are different algorithms that can manipulate users to continue betting.These algorithms can detect that users are about to log off betting platforms and present bonus offers. The communication of the offer can be received in different ways like “personalized messages, free credits, or limited-time promotions, which provide a monetary incentive for users to return to the platform” says (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Continuous tracking of user data allows systems to read users behavior and emotions, in which algorithms influence decisions that lead to more money being spent with the idea that losses can be made up in short periods of time. This case study will continue to explore the unseen role that algorithmic behavior and design behind live sports betting and the impact it has on users ethically and scientifically. 






Developers 

// info from articles

research 


Role or context:

A Developer play a key role in sports betting algorithms as they directly shape how the system works, ultimately influencing user behavior, profit models, and ethical outcomes. Developers reccomend algortihms that will seem appealing to live betters and gamblers in general. With a lot of control developers have the power to impliment safeguards for users when noticable splurge spending is happenng, alongside other warning signs of harmful behavior.

Ethical context:

A developer's ethical lens focuses on building technology and deploying algorithms that are safe. In this case, a developers job is to create attractive models that draw live betters in and persuade them to gamble. Developers must ensure that privacy is protected, and features work properly. They must ensure that they follow industry standards, reduce bias while doing good for the company. Their ethical perspective has to align with human rights but they also must do what's right for the company. In this situation, they're job is to draw more users in so that the company makes as much money as they can. So where is the line drawn?

Stake Holder 1 - The Gambler

Role or Context: 

There are a lot of roles that gamblers play within the sports betting community. They spend their money gambling which keeps apps running. Gamblers are the data for scientists to collect in order to implement the most effective algorithms. Time spent on apps, money lost vs earned, time in between bets etc. Gamblers also shape the algorithms that they see. Spending behaviors, money spent, and overall experience tailor algorithmic design.

Ethical Concern: 

Ethically, sports bettors that spiral into addiction represent the vulnerable population. Algorithms designed to maximize engagement can exploit cognitive bias. Thus, turning vulnerable individuals into targets for manipulation.
