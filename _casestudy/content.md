Role or context:

A Developer play a key role in sports betting algorithms as they directly shape how the system works, ultimately influencing user behavior, profit models, and ethical outcomes. Developers reccomend algortihms that will seem appealing to live betters and gamblers in general. With a lot of control developers have the power to impliment safeguards for users when noticable splurge spending is happenng, alongside other warning signs of harmful behavior.

Ethical context:

A developer's ethical lens focuses on building technology and deploying algorithms that are safe. In this case, a developers job is to create attractive models that draw live betters in and persuade them to gamble. Developers must ensure that privacy is protected, and features work properly. They must ensure that they follow industry standards, reduce bias while doing good for the company. Their ethical perspective has to align with human rights but they also must do what's right for the company. In this situation, they're job is to draw more users in so that the company makes as much money as they can. So where is the line drawn?

Stake Holder 1 - The Gambler

Role or Context: 

There are a lot of roles that gamblers play within the sports betting community. They spend their money gambling which keeps apps running. Gamblers are the data for scientists to collect in order to implement the most effective algorithms. Time spent on apps, money lost vs earned, time in between bets etc. Gamblers also shape the algorithms that they see. Spending behaviors, money spent, and overall experience tailor algorithmic design.

Ethical Concern: 

Ethically, sports bettors that spiral into addiction represent the vulnerable population. Algorithms designed to maximize engagement can exploit cognitive bias. Thus, turning vulnerable individuals into targets for manipulation.
