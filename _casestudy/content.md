    **Introduction**

    Sports have been around forever, dating back to ancient times. Hunting and wrestling were the trailblazers of the sports world that we see now. Sports weren’t documented until around 776 BCE, where the first Olympic Games took place in Greece. Throughout history, sports have evolved into something that globally, people enjoy watching, participating in, and gambling on. In 1992, the PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) effectively banned sports betting in most states. Nevada, being one of the states where it was legal in. By 2010, the state of Nevada was the first state to launch an online sports betting platform called STN sports. By 2018, the Supreme Court overturned PASPA, legalizing online sports betting in multiple states. Since 2025, 38 states, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have legalized sports betting in some form or fashion, and 30 states allow online sports betting. However, rules and regulations differ from state to state based on licensing, tax rates, and eligible sports.
    
    Since the 2020 COVID pandemic, online sports betting has grown tremendously. Algorithmic Persuasion in live sports betting has grasped the sports community in ways that are impacting communities forever. Behind the scenes of live sports betting lies invisible AI-enabled personalization on gaming sites that can affect user experience. There are different algorithms that can manipulate users to continue betting. These algorithms can detect that users are about to log off betting platforms and present bonus offers. The communication of the offer can be received in different ways, like “personalized messages, free credits, or limited-time promotions, which provide a monetary incentive for users to return to the platform,” says (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Continuous tracking of user data allows systems to read user behavior and emotions, in which algorithms influence decisions that lead to more money being spent, with the idea that losses can be made up in short periods of time. This case study will continue to explore the unseen algorithmic behavior behind live sports betting and the impact it has on users ethically and scientifically.

    **The Influence of Data-Driven Systems in User Decision Making**
    
    Data-driven systems play a crucial role in influencing user behavior on live betting Platforms. Real-time data through APIs, low-latency data delivery, and reliable server infrastructure are essential for online betting platforms to continuously update odds and attract user engagement. According to softwaremind.com, advanced algorithms such as dynamic pricing, predictive analytics, odds calculation, and machine learning models adjust odds based on live sports data like injuries, pace of play, or goals scored. Real-time updates and payout conditions increase the likelihood of live betting, encouraging quick responses to live-changing odds. Platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel are exploring the use of AI models to offer real-time odds updates during live sporting events. With AI being able to analyze complex patterns in sports data, the improvement of prediction accuracy identifies trends that favor players or teams on which users rely on while live betting, presenting users with recommendations that appear trustworthy.
​ 
    In addition to analyzing live game data, betting platforms collect and evaluate user behavior, which includes betting history, wager amounts, and time spent between bets. This behavioral data is used to personalize a better experience through tailored offers that reinforce continued engagement. Predictive models like neural networks go through numerous game scenarios, allowing users to make betting decisions based solely on the live odds that are displayed, sometimes without even watching the game, encouraging impulsive behavior and reducing time for reflection. Algorithmic data-driven systems have become the new norm for betting platforms. The help from LLMs has created a continuous feedback loop that encourages repeated betting. This raises ethical concerns about transparency and the harm of compulsive betting.

    **Interface Design and Behvioral Patterns**
    
    Live betting platforms require consistent data integration, real-time information, and a user-friendly interface that allows heavy user traffic. The implementation of features such as, quick bets, cash out, and build your bet make it easier for live betters to place bets so they never miss a bet that is appealing to them. Users build bets that seem to be in their favor, and have the opportunity to cash out when they believe the time is right, possibly placing another bet with the money they just received from a previous bet. Fire bets allow users to seek thrilling, high-stakes, live bets that potentially offer higher rewards, often placed during fast-paced events. Gathering data from user behavior has allowed platforms to optimize live betting in a quick and user-friendly way.

    **Ethical Concerns**

    With regard to how ubiquitous sports gambling is today, ethical concerns attract attention when uncovering the effect that algorithmic persuasion has on gamblers' behavior. Live betting increases the likelihood of addiction due to the fast-paced nature, dynamic odds, and cash-out feature that raises emotional engagement and reduces self-control. Events take place all throughout the day, increasing the likelihood of chasing losses, which is a sign of addiction. The accessibility and normalization of online gambling allow bettors to place bets on their phones quickly, possibly influenced by commercials, advertisements, or famous individuals. This attracts younger audiences, as they see someone they may admire pushing an agenda to bet with the opportunity to win big. Financially, addiction to live betting and betting in general leads to financial losses, debt, and ongoing problems that affect one's financial situation dramatically. These losses have an effect on not only individuals but also families and societies as they increase the likelihood of depression, suicide, and violence.

    However, the Government and regulators need to implement responsible gambling principles to prevent harm. Platforms must have safeguards to reduce addiction risks, such as responsible gambling information, hotlines, and measures that detect and prevent addictive behavior. These efforts help promote ethical behavior and protect customers.

    **Conclusion**

    Sports have evolved into entertainment that you only watch and cheer for. Data analytics, personalization with AI, and interface design have joined together to promote user decision-making. These technologies enhance user engagement but also raise ethical concerns by encouraging impulsive behavior and potential addiction to online gambling through algorithmic persuasion. With the growth of online gambling, transparency, safeguards, responsible gambling, and regulatory monitoring are key to a safe balance between user safety and technological advancements.
