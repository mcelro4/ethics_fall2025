Stake Holder 1 - The Gambler

Role or Context: 

There are a lot of roles that gamblers play within the sports betting community. They spend their money gambling which keeps apps running. Gamblers are the data for scientists to collect in order to implement the most effective algorithms. Time spent on apps, money lost vs earned, time in between bets etc. Gamblers also shape the algorithms that they see. Spending behaviors, money spent, and overall experience tailor algorithmic design.

Ethical Concern: 

Ethically, sports bettors that spiral into addiction represent the vulnerable population. Algorithms designed to maximize engagement can exploit cognitive bias. Thus, turning vulnerable individuals into targets for manipulation.
