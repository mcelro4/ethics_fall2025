In Amanda Musa article "AI technology to detect guns in schools sparks debate" she presents contrasting views from experts. Chad Marlow from the ACLU who claims that AI technology is unreliable and Dave Fraiser from Omnilert who aregues that AI can help detect weapons in schools and mitigate harm. 

**News Article:**  
[This AI technology was supposed to detect guns in school. Here’s what happened outside Nashville](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/us/ai-gun-detection-software-antioch-school/index.html)

P1: AI is being used to detect weapons in school

P2: It's almost impossible to stop school shootings from happening

P3: Surveillance visibility is highly important for software to activate

P4: False positives are an issue with AI detection

C: Therefore, many factors lead to school shootings and AI can be used to mitigate violence.

Rebutal

P1 Challenge: While AI is being used to detect harm, recent results show it is often innacurate and unreliable.

P2 Challenge: The idea that gun harm is almost impossible to stop, there are ther ways to mitigate school shooting. Imporved mental health resources and greater school security can prevent such harms as well.

P3 Challenge: Depending on visibility will limit AI's capabilities. Poor camera angles or concealed weapons can limit the systems usefulness during an imoirtant matter. 

P4 Challenge: Tools that are unreliable shouldn't be used in high stakes situations. Flase positives lead to time wasted that could be used for saving lives or deesculating situations.

R: The use of AI has many holes that don't fulfill the claims that software experts assure to the public and authorities.

C2: Using AI tools to identify weapons in school systems can accelerate response times by police authorities and educators. As long as these systems are continuously monitored for errors and updates students and educators lives can be protected from mass harm.

Refelction: I was interested in reading about AI being used for a major problem in the U.S. , school shootings. I think it is important to realize that AI isn't perfect, but a resource to help kick start ideas on how to solve problems. Whether it's used for class, everyday questions, or world problems. AI has the capability of being powerful and solving problems that can advance our nation. These articles are very interesting to read and I enjoy these assignments.
