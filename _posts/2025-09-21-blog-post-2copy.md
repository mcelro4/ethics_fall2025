AI fails to detect weapons, leading to preventable gun violence in schools.

**News Article:**  
[This AI technology was supposed to detect guns in school. Hereâ€™s what happened outside Nashville](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/us/ai-gun-detection-software-antioch-school/index.html)

P1: AI is being used to detect weapons in school

P2: It's almost impossible to stop school shootings from happening

P3: Surveillance visibility is highly important for software to activate

P4: False positives are an issue with AI detection

C: Therefore, many factors lead to school shootings and AI can be used to mitigate violence.

Rebutal

P1 Challenge: Although AI is assisting police departments and school systems with gun detection, there are kinks in AI and software that have failed and led to school shootings being worse than they should have been.

P2 Challenge: AI isn't meant to stop school shootings it is used to mitigate the damage that can occur by lack of response time
from authorities and school officials.

P3 Challenge: Surveillance detection is only possible if weapons are in clear view.

P4 Challenge: With all technology and systems there will be imperfections.

R: The use of AI has many holes that don't fulfill the claims that software experts assure to the public and authorities.

C2: Using AI tools to identify weapons in school systems can accelerate response times by police authorities and educators. As long as these systems are continuously monitored for errors and updates students and educators lives can be protected from mass harm.

Refelction: I was interested in reading about AI being used for a major problem in the U.S. , school shootings. I think it is important to realize that AI isn't perfect, but a resource to help kick start ideas on how to solve problems. Whether it's used for class, everyday questions, or world problems. AI has the capability of being powerful and solving problems that can advance our nation. These articles are very interesting to read and I enjoy these assignments.
