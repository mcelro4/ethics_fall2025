[Complete Delete: In Practice, Clicking 'Delete' Rarely Deletes. Should it?](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/fesqymtr/release/3?readingCollection=ca73f7c0)

Brief Summary:

Is your information completely deleted? System designers make the decisions if they wish to impliment systems that never delete anything or backup files. Is it up to chance whether or not your information will be deleted?

Discussion Questions:

Propose approaches for informing users of the existence of remnant data on their systems.

Since modern storage systems store 8-bit bytes rather than 7-bit characters and a separate check bit it is harder to completely delete photos, files, and other images that you may download or save. A proposed solution that I have for informing users of the existence of remnant data on their system is notifying users when their information or photos haven't been deleted fully. Giving a step by step process on how to thoroughly delete files or images for good can protect users' sensitive information. Another solution would consist of implementing a pop up that notifies users when their information hasn't been fully deleted or if a website or company uses a backup system to store deleted files/images. This will allow users to pick and choose what they want to save or download so that they can be protected from organizations that keep sensitive information in a cloud.

Compare the advantages of deleting information with information permanence.

The advantages of deleting information:

Deleting information provides a sense of privacy, safety, user control, and memory saving. It allows users to practice information rights, and with devices like apple and microsoft there are legal requirements that allow users to know their informatio. has been deleted, although these companies could keep sensitive information. Additionally, the article talks about relationships and how intimate photos may be shared between partners. If the relationship goes south it is an advantage to know that users can delete images or conversations for their own comfort or safety without others sharing.

The advantages of information permanence:

The advantages of information permanence include recovering data that you need, using information(photos/files) for legal reasons, and or recovery research for organizations. From my personal experience, I have accidentally deleted files or images that I need and it is nice when there is a recovery system. I deleted my git repository during my sophomore year of college on accident and my professor was able to recover it so that I could push work to my repo for grading. This is an example of an advantage that may be useful within information permanence.

It is common for the ‘infotainment’ systems in rental cars to remember and display the names and address books of telephones that were recently paired with the car. Typically, this information is from previous rentals. Although some infotainment systems have a ‘system reset’ function that makes all of the records appear to vanish, it is rare for this function to be executed between rentals. Why might this be the case, and how would you design things differently to improve privacy protection? How could you assure that the captured data is actually overwritten, rather than simply left as deleted files that could be later recovered using forensic tools?

I have thought about this before reading this case study as it applies to my own experiences. Whenever I connect my phone to a rental car for maps or music and the car has carplay or different user interface displays I sometimes see other peoples names. It is alarming to know that most of the rental cars don't automatically delete users' information. I would design it in a way that there is a start time you're going to be renting the car and an end time on the display and when the time runs out it gives the renter a pop up notification that their capabilities are about to end. I would also add a delete option after the timer runs out so they can do it themselves, rather than rely on the system built in. With recovered files mentioned before I would ensure that users know that data is being collected for vehicle performance but not their personal data like addresses, phone numbers, etc.

Object overwriting is a straightforward, well-understood approach for eliminating the ability to recover deleted data. However, software engineers have not made object overwriting mandatory on today’s computer systems because it would negatively impact performance and battery life. This is a decision that must be made at the system level; it cannot be made a user option. Do you think that systems should employ object overwriting, or do you think that the current approach of not overwriting is correct?

I think that there is a fine line for object overwriting. If you are deleting information that could be used against you in court then object overwriting should be prohibited. I think that the current approach is correct because many people accidentally delete things they need and being able to recover that info is helpful. But it could be used in non ethical ways with the government, politicians, etc.

My Question:

Does information permanence create more social benefits or risk?
I chose this question in order to think about both sides. Could information permanence hold people accountable, help with historical records(to name a few) or intrude on privacy rights, and make people remember things they would like to forget?

Reflection:

I enjoyed reading about privacy, recovery and deleting data. The article dove into recovery of data and new systems/technologies that are implimented in big corperations like Apple and Microsoft. I learned about the do's and dont's of deleting data, as well as balancing the needs of users between litigation and law enforcement. With technology today it can be scary that people can have your data forever without you knowing after you delete. Almost suggesting accountabilty for everyone.
