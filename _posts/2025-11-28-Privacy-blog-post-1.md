[Complete Delete: In Practice, Clicking 'Delete' Rarely Deletes. Should it?](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/fesqymtr/release/3?readingCollection=ca73f7c0)

Brief Summary

IS your information completely deleted? System designers make the decisions if they wish to impliment systems that never delete anything or backup files. Is it up to chance whether or not your information will be deleted?

Discussion Questions:

Propose approaches for informing users of the existence of remnant data on their systems.

Since modern storage systems store 8-bit bytes rather than 7-bit characters and a separate check bit it is harder to completely delete photos, files, and other images that you may download or save. A proposed solution that I have for informing users of the existence of remnant data on their system is notifying users when their information or photos haven't been deleted fully. Giving a step by step process on how to thoroughly delete files or images for good can protect users' sensitive information. Another solution would consist of implementing a pop up that notifies users when their information hasn't been fully deleted or if a website or company uses a backup system to store deleted files/images. This will allow users to pick and choose what they want to save or download so that they can be protected from organizations that keep sensitive information in a cloud.

Compare the advantages of deleting information with information permanence.

The advantages of deleting information:

Deleting information provides a sense of privacy, safety, user control, and memory saving. It allows users to practice information rights, and with devices like apple and microsoft there are legal requirements that allow users to know their informatio. has been deleted, although these companies could keep sensitive information. Additionally, the article talks about relationships and how intimate photos may be shared between partners. If the relationship goes south it is an advantage to know that users can delete images or conversations for their own comfort or safety without others sharing.

The advantages of information permanence:

The advantages of information permanence include recovering data that you need, using information(photos/files) for legal reasons, and or recovery research for organizations. From my personal experience, I have accidentally deleted files or images that I need and it is nice when there is a recovery system. I deleted my git repository during my sophomore year of college on accident and my professor was able to recover it so that I could push work to my repo for grading. This is an example of an advantage that may be useful within information permanence.
