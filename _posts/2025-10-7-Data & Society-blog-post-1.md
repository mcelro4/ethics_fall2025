Can Data help the Black Maternal Health Crisis?

**Youtube Video:**  
[Databite 160: Black Maternal Health is in Crisis. Can Technology Help?](https://youtu.be/8aBZds_FrHM?si=w7fg3Fsl8UazdrUW)

• Who: Who are the speakers? What expertise, background, or perspectives do they
bring?

The speakers in the video I watched were Mary Flemming(Cayaba Care), Ijeoma Uche (Birth by Us), and the interviewer was Joan Mukogosi(data and society). Dr. Mary flemming works clinically in Baltimore MD and Louisville KY, who co-founded Cayaba care. She has served as the director of leadership development to advance equity in healthcare programs in the department of executive and continuing professional education, at the Harvard TH Chan school of public health. Ms. Uche is the co-founder of "Birth By Us" post-pardament pregnancy app for women of color, which helps shape their own birthing experience, while giving providers and hospitals insights to best support their pregnancy, birth, and post-pardom journey. Her expertise helps reduce preventable maternal health deaths and complications. Both women of Color, bring primary expertise on ways technology can help mitigate maternal complications and support for black women.

• What: What are the main arguments, cases, or examples being discussed?

The main arguments include how data is helping address the needs of black women pre and post maternity. How people use, chart, and record information is evolving, so understanding that they are not putting people at risk is a priority. Ultimately mitigating risk of maternity is the main goal. Another argument is that "we need to be more attentive to models and data that we're using, so that we're not continuing the existing disparities and biases that currently exist in space and research". So using diverse data sets and detecting biases helps treat communities of color. Empowering patients so that they can make their own decisions is a fundamental goal that Mary and Ijeoma are trying to reach. Especially with the advancement of AI.

• Where: What context is this happening in (social, political, cultural, or technological)?

I think that cultural, and technological are areas of importance pertaining to this video. The speakers cover cultural specific care and how care is tailored differently towards specific ethnicities. Ijeoma mentions reaching the communities of color and letting them have a seat at the table in order for them to gain insight on digital health care which is important, as it builds trust between patients and providers. Technologically, with the advancement of AI and tech health care, the importance of accurate data is a focal point that the speakers covered; As it reduces problems during maternity when data is precise, transparent, and understandable, specifically for women during maternity or after.

• Why: Why is this issue being discussed now? What’s at stake?

This issue is being discussed now because of the advancement in digital health care. The speakers mention the historical differences during maternity. Back then maternity has been a personable experience, seeing your doctor, check-ups with OBs, at home care, and hospital based experiences. These norms have shifted to more digital experiences and there seems to be a disjointed connection with care. What's at stake ultimately comes down to the lives of these women during maternity and after. Providing help and resources to these women decreases the chances of critical mistakes that can happen during maternity, especially for black women.

• How: How do the speakers explain, critique, or propose solutions? How do they
connect ideas to broader debates?

With the advancement of digital health care, the speakers emphasize the excitement behind these developments and the importance of asking questions so that women know where data is coming from and what it's being used for in order to mitigate  fear that may arise when their data is being shared. The speakers propose the solution that a bridge must be gapped with digital health care, and there should be a balance of communication between health organizations and patients. Mary connects the evolution of maternity care with the broader conversation of healthcare as a whole. How people access maternity care has changed and today the post and pre maternity process has also changed and become more digital, so providing resources to these women to meet their wants and needs is a big priority. Everyone has their own unique journey so tailoring each other's needs in order to have a safe pregnancy is the goal.

• So What: Why does this matter? How does it connect to the world, to your own
knowledge/experience, or to your role as a technologist?

This matters to me for two specific reasons. One, I study computer science and I am very interested in Data Science and Analytics. It never crossed my mind that fallacies in data highly affected black women during maternity. I recently learned about data in healthcare and how hospitals are transitioning to digital healthcare. As a technologist, it is important to understand when data is wrong or biased, considering the magnitude of the situations, peoples futures are in your hands so upholding ethically right decisions is a role that needs to be emphasized. Reason number 2 has to do with my ethnicity. I am A black male and I have a sister, cousins, and friends that may go through the maternity process later on in life. As a technologist I would want to uphold a standard in tech health care so that all women of color are receiving the same care and education. Ultimately, allowing them to understand data insights, and know what certain data means when interacting digitally or human to human during maternity.

Open Ended question: 
How can new technology help aleiviate inequalties for black women in maternity?

I chose this question because new ideas are being presented every day on how women can benefit from tech health care. In the video the speakers talk about situations that hold black women back from getting the help they need, whether it's lack of transportation or resources. Black women in maternity are at a disadvantage so providing seminars or help groups for these women could be a big step in advancing knowledge within these individuals so that they know how to navigate their unique journeys with maternity.

Reflection:

I enjoyed listening to these women speak about technology in health care and how it can be used to help black women understand the evolution of maternity. Our society is moving away from a complete person-to-person interaction in health care, specifically maternity. To me the most important factor deals with these women understanding ways that they can receive help or resources through new technological advancements. Ultimately, reducing risks that have been present in past years due to the systemic lack of resources or help. Personally, this video allowed me to learn more about maternity as a whole and ways I could possibly implement the technical strategies discussed in the video. (i.e. unbiased data, accessibility to resources, and data that can be read by the general public.)
