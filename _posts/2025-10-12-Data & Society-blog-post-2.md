[From Mining to E-waste: The Environmental and Climate Justice Implications of the Electronics Hardware Life Cycle](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/w9ht6hue/release/5?readingCollection=ca73f7c0)

1: What might pose challenges to the proposed solutions to the issues surrounding e-waste? Why might certain stakeholders oppose any of the solutions?

Challenges that may arise with proposed solutions to e-waste include spending a lot of money in order to pay for these solutions, and for big corporations this may cut into the budget or decrease profits. Additionally, the cost of recycling these electronics is highly expensive due to the materials that form these devices. Certain stakeholders may oppose these solutions because it could affect their flow of business. For instance the article states that the global north is the primary producer of e-waste but it ends up mostly in the global south. Enforcing stricter environmental regulations and increasing  labor would effect how much e-waste organizations in the global north could dispose of.

2: What are your thoughts on the role of the CE in addressing issues in the electronics hardware life cycle? Could recycling e-waste help reduce natural resource extraction for electronics hardware manufacturing, or is this an overly ambitious assumption? Why or why not

I think that the role of CE in addressing issues is useful in terms of a vision/ goal for maximizing the reuse of recycling resources. However, the article does state that there is no standardized way to assess the success of the CE practices so that is a big step. Yes, recycling e-waste could reduce natural resource extraction for electronics. It's like humans throwing out plastic water bottles, it was probably an overly ambitious assumption when first brought up but once enough people practice this standard and regulations are implemented, it can be a success.

3:After reviewing , which aspect of the CE or LCA process stands out to you as having the most potential to address climate and environmental injustices or sustainability challenges? Which area faces the most potential challenges now and in the future? How do you see LCA interacting with CE in addressing these issues?

Increasing regulations and awareness(CE) has the most potential in my opinion because these policy makers would be able to  implement laws that had to be followed. Addressing these issues to the larger population would create movements and raise environmental concern. I think repairing and refurbishing these electronics would face the most potential challenges because companies like Apple and Samsung mass produce new electronics every year in which they rely on profit from people buying new devices. I see the CA addressing these issues by spreading awareness to the community and getting people to vote for new regulations.

4:Fair trade certifications, which identify goods that are produced without jeopardizing the health and safety of both workers and the environment, are much more common in the agricultural, food, and clothing industries. However, Fairphone, a company that makes responsibly and sustainably designed modular electronics, provides at least one example of fair trade in the electronics industry. Can you envision a situation in which our electronics have different levels of fair trade designations? Would you choose to buy electronics that claim to be manufactured in socially and ethically responsible ways? Why or why not?

I can see a situation where the level of fair trade designations depends on the size of the company. With bigger companies, levels of fair trade designations are most likely less ethical. I would choose to buy electronics that claim to be manufactured in socially and ethically responsible ways because I know that people were being treated fair and environmental concerns would be accounted for. Unfortunately, I do buy a lot of electronics from big corporations because of their reputation and reliability.

5: How could you address some of the environmental and climate justice issues associated with electronics hardwareâ€”either in your position within higher education or in the future post-graduation? What challenges do you anticipate?

In my position as a college student I could address issues associated with electronics hardware by communicating these issues to the CS department or making people aware of these issues. Considering that many of the CS students would want to work with big tech companies they would know the impact that these companies had on the environment. I would anticipate the challenge of students caring. We are in college so it's not a big concern for many students.

My Question: 

If E-waste continues to affect the environment, what long-term impacts could these issues have on global health and the environment?
I chose this question because it's apparent that climate change is affecting our globe now so I think it's important to note the impact that continued environmental harm could have. 

Reflection: 

Reflecting on this exercise, it allowed me to gain knowledge on how electronic waste is impacting the environment. Expanding on the issues we read about in class regarding datacenters and how much water they need alongside the fossil fuels burned to keep these datacenters running, this reading expanded my knowledge of the issues imminent in the world. The CE and LCA diagrams were also helpful for visual understanding of the process that mitigates the issues of electronic waste.
