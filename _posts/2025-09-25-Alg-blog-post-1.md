Are data driven rules taking over? When are they appropriate and when are they not!

**News Article:**  
[The Right to Be an Exception to a Data-Driven Rule](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/right-to-be-exception/release/2)

1: What is a data-driven rule, and what does it mean to be a data-driven exception? Is
an exception the same as an error?

A data driven rule is a tool that is used to make consequential decisions. What it means to be a data driven exception is the act where an individual should not be held accountable when they are, through no fault of their own. I think an exception is a flaw not an error. Something that needs to be reconsidered. Flaws aren't always errors.

2: In addition to those listed above, what other factors differentiate data-driven decisions
from human ones?

Data driven rules make decisions faster, while humans make decisions slower, i.e. job applications. Modern machine learning makes decisions based on patterns while humans do not. Humans have the capability to have diverse thought processes, one employee may not like a certain application while another employee may notice qualities they like in the candidate.

3: Beyond what is discussed above, what are some of the benefits and downsides of individualization?

Benefits of individualization include, tailoring rules to benefit a specific person or group so that the performance is greater. It also appears in large text as well as technical ones. In machine learning individualization is very useful, as many data driven rules are often justified based on their level of independence. However, I think that there are cons to tailored rules. Certain demographics are not considered when rules are too specific. Also privacy concerns are a point of emphasis when associating with individualization.

4: Why is uncertainty so critical to the right to be an exception? When the stakes are
high (e.g., in criminal sentencing), is there any evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy) that
can justify the use of a data-driven rule without the consideration of uncertainty?

Uncertainty flags down critical questions that need to be addressed when complementing it with exceptions. Using the process of elimination, average is reliable when thinking about data-driven rules but there is some uncertainty that averages may not work or apply to specific scenarios/individuals. I think precision is a matric that can justify the use of data-driven rules without uncertainty purely based on how consistent the metric is. In my own life, an example of this would be my hockey team going into a shootout. On average a player may score 30% of the time in a shootout but another player may score on this specific goalie more often in a certian area of the net making him more reliable. Ultimately, precision is more accuarte for specific sceanrios. 

Task 3: My discussion question. 

In an ethical situation, what ethical framework should be prioritized(uncertainty, individualization, and harm) and how would you rank them from most important to least important? I chose this question because it relates to how some considerations and actions that are backed up by data-driven rules depend on human interaction and machine interaction; changing the outcome of certain decision making.

Reflection:

Reflecting on this assignment, I liked the structure of the article. It laid out the three main components of data-driven rules, (uncertainty, individualization, and harm) making it easy to follow along with regards to how long the article was. Writing in the blog format has become a lot easier with practice. Committing my blogs to my personal website is cleaner now that I have done it a few times. The layout of files that we have to navigate through is user friendly in my opinion. Updating the links and tags works nicely and is straightforward.
