Task 1: Re-Encountering Your Work

Superlative Round #1: Choose one blog post and assign it a superlative (e.g., most
fun, most challenging, most surprising, most informative, most frustrating).Why did
you choose this superlative? What specific features or moments in your post earned it
this title?

For my first superlative, I am choosing the most informative blog post, which is Society and Data blog 2. In this blog post I read about E-mining and the environmental factors behind large data facilities. I chose this superlative because I had little knowledge about the harmful effects that data centers and E-mining had on the environment. Specific features that earned this title had to do with E-waste, data mining, and recycling. Continuous data mining leads to fossil fuels burning which is already an ongoing issue in the world. Recycling old electronics can be expensive so that's why it's hard for companies to implement recycling. This issue ends up being another region's problem, as the global north is the primary producer of E-waste and the waste ends up in the global south. Learning about the logistics and effects of technology as. The whole was insightful with regards to ethics in computer science.

Superlative Round #2: Select a different blog post and choose a new superlative. What
stands out about this post compared to the others? How does reflecting on it help you
notice changes in your writing or thinking?

For the second blog post, I am choosing Misinformation blog 1. The superlative I am giving this blog is fun. I really enjoyed reading about misinformation as it is a problem in today's society. This blog post stood out compared to others because I really got to dive deeper into misinformation and the different sub-categories of misinformation. It is something that college students like myself can attest to. With phones and the internet being a part of everyday life, reading about misinformation and the connectedness with AI was interesting to read about. It's like the power is in the younger generations hands. We have the choice to mitigate misinformation or add to it. We may support misinformation without trying to, like liking deepfake videos or talking about fake news we see on tik tok or instagram. Reflecting on it helps me notice changes in my thinking because I become aware of misinformation and ways that it is being used against people today.

Blog Evolution Check: Choose one blog that you significantly revised. What did
you change, and why? How did your later knowledge or improved skills influence the
revision?

I revised Ethics blog 2. I misinterpreted that the author had a claim or argument but she didn't. The arguments she mentioned in her article came from other people. This improved my later knowledge on the article as I looked at it differently and it made more sense. I was able to revise the Ps of the blog and rebuttal in a more clear way connected with the first part.

Task 2: Understanding Your Writing Process

Writing Skills and Growth: A key goal of this course was to help you develop writing
skills. In what ways do you feel your writing has improved (or not)? What parts of
the blog-writing process was most helpful for your growth? Were there aspects you
struggled with?

I feel like my writing has improved tremendously which is funny to say because this is a CS class. I was able to connect the articles we read to my own personal opinion and experience which made my writing skills more thorough. The most helpful part of the blog-writing process were the discussion questions. This allowed me to structure my post in a neat way where I could specifically talk about the main points in the article. I struggled with my grammar a bit. I got better over time but I tend to miss out on the small grammar techniques that improve the quality of my writing.

Process Comparison: Would you have preferred writing traditional essays instead of
blogs? Why or why not? What differences did you notice between writing for an online
audience and writing for a typical academic assignment?

I would rather write blog posts because they are more connected with my personal thought process. Essays feel like a chore while blog posts feel like a free write with structure. I notice that writing for an online audience allows me to express my thoughts in a personal way rather than a strict academic way while still improving my writing skills. It also mirrors what it would be like to have a website for users to use or look up in a real world setting.

Patterns and Habits: What common themes, writing habits, or stylistic choices do you
notice across your blogs? Did any habits change over the semester?

I notice a common theme of connecting articles we read to my own personal experiences. I also notice the continuous structure of my blog post is the same. Pasting the questions and writing my thoughts under each question. I think it helps the reader follow along when the questions are present and it adds a neat element to my post. My habits stayed the same during the semester but my grammar improved and being more expressive in my writing improved.

Task 3: Connecting to Course Content

Topics and Themes: Which class topics did you enjoy writing about most, and why?
Is there a topic that you wish we had covered in class? What kind of prompts or
activities helped you generate ideas most effectively?

I enjoyed writing about misinformation in general, privacy, and ethics as a whole. I liked learning about topics I was already interested in. Seeing how problems I think about daily are being talked about online ignited genuine curiosity to learn more. Specifically with AI, like robot dogs, and privacy. I watched Snowden when I was younger and have always been curious about how accurate the movie was so learning about how it's a big deal was interesting to know. I think we covered all the topics that were necessary to this class. Podcasts helped me generate tons of ideas that connected to class material. The black mirror episode was one of the most exciting assignments I've had in college and it was a way to learn and talk about technology and AI in a fun way.

Knowledge Integration: Did writing blogs help you understand course concepts more
deeply? Can you identify a moment where something “clicked” because you had to
write about it?

Yes, blog posts helped me understand course concepts more because they were enjoyable. A moment where something clicked was during the youtube video I had to watch for data and society blog 1. I learned about Maternity specifically for Black women. I didn't know much going into it but it clicked after watching the video and how the speakers broke down how healthcare systems are using women's data without them knowing as well as these women not knowing how to read their own data and how person to person visits and the overall process of having a child is becoming virtual which leaves these women clueless. Writing about it helped me understand this problem more in depth.

Task 4: Connecting to Course Content
Future Use of Your Website: Now that you have your own blog and website, what kinds
of content do you imagine posting after this course? Do you see yourself continuing
the blog? Why or why not?

I imagine myself posting my thoughts about certain topics that I come across. If I am reading or watching something that relates to the content on my website I think I would have a section titled, Kelijahs Thoughts! So people can read what I'm thinking. I could see myself continuing the blog later. When I get a job I could talk about my own experience as someone with a job and how it connects to certain topics we have covered like ethics in the workforce. (If I am allowed!!)

Future Writing Identity: What kind of writer do you see yourself becoming beyond
this class? Are there types of writing (creative, academic, technical, reflective) that
you’d like to explore more?

I see myself staying on track with the blog format of writing. It invites creativity alongside academic aspects of writing as well. I would like to explore technical writing more as it would help with professional writing in the workplace.

Personal Writing Goals: If you were to set one writing goal for yourself for next semester
or next year, what would it be? What steps could you realistically take to move toward
That goal?

My goal would be to improve my vocabulary. This would help me write quality academic papers or content for a website. I'm not saying I want to know it all but I always run into a situation where I think to myself, there has got to be a better word for what I am trying to say that sounds better. Realistically, I could read more books and academic articles that have quality vocabulary.
