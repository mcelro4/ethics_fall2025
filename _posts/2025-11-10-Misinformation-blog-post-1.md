Brief Summary

This case study presents the acts on censorship in social media and the misinformation that affects platforms coexisting with democratic rights. Kevin Mills explores the ways to mitigate misinformation online.

Discussion Questions:

This case study discusses several examples in which misinformation appears to be worse now than it was in the past (e.g., vaccine skepticism and election conspiracies). Can you think of any other examples? How confident are you that this misinformation really is worse now?

With the advancement of Ai I have seen deepfakes used on presidents or politicians that make claims that they never said. Another example I have seen today is pyramid schemes. We discussed this in class and how they can cause harm to people without the intention to because they are promoting false information. I am confident that misinformation is worse now because there are more tools that make it easier to create or spread misinformation. In our society almost everyone has a phone and social media is a big part of our lives at the moment so this leads to widespread news at faster rates than ever seen before.

What things can you truly know by yourself, without relying on the trustworthiness of any other people and/or institutions?

In order to truly know things by yourself without the trust of others and institutions you almost have to live through it. For example a soldier goes to war and he sees how many civilians are being treated by enemy groups. He creates his own idea on the situation and now has proof that there are good people everywhere. Versus someone reading about what someone put online whether it's in favor or against the situation. Personally, I can truly know how my peers' personalities are, who's nice, shy, mean etc. I think it comes down to seeing it yourself. The article mentions a good point that states, "becoming informed typically isn’t something you can do by yourself;". It is a social process and that is where we are as a society at the moment.

What strategies can you employ to avoid falling for misinformation online?

I can employ the strategy of assessing information based on who's saying it. Is it experts and/or is it someone trustworthy enough or communicable to express facts without opinion or bias. I can also research topics that have different viewpoints or seem shady. Thus, allowing me to fact check what i've seen.

If censorship were likely to be an effective tool in combatting misinformation on social media, would it be justified? Why or why not? And if so, in what cases and to what extent?

The article mentions scenarios where censorship is uncontroversially a good idea, like hate speech and "child pornography". There are subjects that as a larger group are agreed upon based on moral rights and wrongs. The area where it may not be justified is when people's opinions are taken away from them, socially. Political views, truth telling, or the spread of awareness sometimes is taken down by higher ups or people running apps based on what their views are which taps into rights of speech. This is where it may not be justified because people have the right to their opinion and when that is taken away it goes against the first amendment. Ultimately, I think it would be justified if people educated themselves to know whether information is false.

My question:

Who should have the authority to determine what is misinformation? The government, app developers, or users?
I chose this question because as just a user I feel like all three play a role in what stays up and what is taken down. For example as a user of tiktok, if something is up that shouldn't be, there is the option to report it and that allows users to have a say.

Reflection:

I really liked reading this case study. I think it strongly relates to college students because we are on social media all the time. We see stuff on the internet that may be questionable but sometimes we look right past it. This case study opened up my eyes about ways to educate myself on misinformation and explore the question whether censorship of misinformation goes against democratic values.
